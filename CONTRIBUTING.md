# Contribution Guidelines

**To add to the list:** Submit a pull request

**To remove from the list:** Open an issue

When editing the list:

- List items should be sorted alphabetically
- Each item should be limited to one link
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome

Please only contribute links to libraries or projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.


## Quality standard

To stay on the list, libraries/projects/resources should adhere to these quality standards:

- Generally useful to the community
- Documented enough so that a person unfamiliar with the project can get it working
- Actively maintained (even if that just means acknowledging open issues when they arise)
- Open source license is clearly indicated


## Reporting issues

If you see any errors or have any suggestions for improvements, please open an issue. If you are at Janelia, you could also just send an email or Slack message to Konrad Rokicki.
